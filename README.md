# COVID19

During the summer of 2020, members of the CoDE lab at San Francisco State University created the Science Coding Immersion Program (SCIP) 
to provide an opportunity for students to learn R and Python as coding skills that would help in the research and their careers. This also allowed students
to participate in summer opportunities, as the pandemic had cancelled many summer internship and learning opportunities. 

This data and plot were utilized as an example of what students may be able to do using R or Python skills they learned over the summer into a mini project. 
The examples provided allowed for the students to practice subsetting, creating graphs, and manipulating data through coding.
